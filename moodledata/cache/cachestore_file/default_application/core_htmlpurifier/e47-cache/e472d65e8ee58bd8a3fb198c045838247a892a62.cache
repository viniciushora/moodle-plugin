s:918:"<p>The choice activity module enables a teacher to ask a single question and offer a selection of possible responses.</p>

<p>Choice results may be published after students have answered, after a certain date, or not at all. Results may be published with student names or anonymously (though teachers always see student names and their responses).</p>

<p>A choice activity may be used</p>

<ul>
<li>As a quick poll to stimulate thinking about a topic</li>
<li>To quickly test students' understanding</li>
<li>To facilitate student decision-making, for example allowing students to vote on a direction for the course</li>
</ul>
